## Platoon Administration Software

#### This is a side project that I am working on just because. It is designed to manage a platoon with a calendar for appointments, information, and personnel database. This has been designed to run on a raspberrypi 3 with an RFID reader for identification. There is no reason why it wouldn't be able to run on another OS with some minor modifications to the RFID input portion.

Requires:
- Python 2.7
- PySide
- PyQt4
- PyUSB
